In particolar the citychrone project aims to introduce simple and meaningful quantities to measure different aspect of the city, starting from public transport efficiency analisys. 

The CityChrone project aims to introduce a new way to produce and share scientific results. 
The results are presented using modern interactive interfaces and simple and reporducible quantities to measure our cities. All the code is open source and the data used and produced will be "open", easy to download and reproduce.
